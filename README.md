## About

Place is being developed with Vue CLI (https://cli.vuejs.org). The idea of this project is demonstrate how to use the Placesapi from Google.

## Environment Setup

This project uses environments variables to set the base url to connect with a apis service. You'll need to rebase it whenever it changes.

**Note** \*  
Before starting the server you need to create `.env` at the root of the project and make the environment variables configuration.
The .env structure currently is very simple: VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_BASE_URL_SERVICE.
